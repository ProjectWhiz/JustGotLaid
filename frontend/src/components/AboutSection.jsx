                At Just Got Laid, we believe that happy hens lay the best eggs. Our family farm has been dedicated to ethical, sustainable egg production for over a decade. Our hens roam freely on pasture, enjoying fresh air, sunshine, and a natural diet that results in eggs with incredible flavor and nutrition.
              </p>
              <p className="about-paragraph">
                We're passionate about providing our community with the freshest, highest-quality eggs while maintaining the highest standards of animal welfare and environmental responsibility.
